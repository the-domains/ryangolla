Today is the first day of 2016! Status check - I'm 36, married with 2 kids, living in the north west of Sydney. Current weather here is nice and sunny with a few clouds in the sky...

Plans for today is to just have a nice relaxing day. Possibly take the kids out to the shops. Sort out some stuff at home and start organising for the new year.
